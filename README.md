### Continued development

I will continue to use frontend mentor as I learn frontend development and design. For future development I look to get more into CSS grid for the more advanced layouts and landing page challanges  and also give me concept on how to tackle challenges 

### Useful resources

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - This helped me for validation reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward and help me crosscheck errors in my html code 
- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - This is an amazing stuff which helped me finally understand how to check errors im my code. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
